# WordPress Useful Snippets
This repository contains the WordPress useful snippets that I usually use in my projects. I believe that they are also useful
for other developers. That's why I share them in this repository. 
If you think they are useful, please fork or give me a star!

If you need any new snippets, drop me a message in the pull request.
